# Java Target Game

Welcome to my Java Target Game! This simple yet entertaining game allows you to test your aim accuracy.

## How to Play
1. **Download and Setup**: Ensure you have Java installed on your system. Download the game files and extract them to your desired location or clone the repository.
   
2. **Run the Game**: Open the folder in a compiler like VS Code.

3. **Gameplay**: Once the game starts, you'll see a target (a magenta circle) on your screen. Use your mouse to click them. Every time that you click the target, it will respawn at a new location.

4. **Scoring**: Each successful click on a target earns you +10 points. Your score is displayed at the top left of the screen. Try to achieve the highest score possible! For every miss (click outside the circle) 10 points will be subtracted from your score. Be careful! The score can go negative!

6. **Restart**: You can restart the game at any time by pressing the "R" key on your keyboard.

7. **Pause**: You can pause the game by hitting the Escape ("esc") key on your keyboard.
