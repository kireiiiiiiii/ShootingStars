# ⭐️ Shooting Stars ⭐️

### Specifications

This game was build using Java.

## Goal of the game

The goal of the game is to shoot as many stars from the sky as posible, in a given time limit. Each successfuly shot star will earn you 10 points. Try to achieve the highest score possible, before the time runs out. For every miss (click outside the circle) 10 points will be subtracted from your score. However the your score is floored to 10 points, so you can't go negative.☺️

## How to set up

1. **Download and Setup**: Ensure you have Java installed on your system. Download the game files and extract them to your desired location or clone the repository.
2. **Run the Game**: Open the folder in a compiler like VS Code. There run the AppMain.java file.
3. **Packaging**: For packaging, use the <code>gradle shadowjar</code> command.
   _NOTE_: the <code>gradle jar</code> command doesn't work, because it for some reason doesn't include my Maven plugins
4. **Distribution**: For packaging into a distribution version (<code>.zip</code>) use <code>gradle asseble</code>.
